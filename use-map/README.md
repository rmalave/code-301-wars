# Use map() to double the values in an array
https://www.codewars.com/kata/use-map-to-double-the-values-in-an-array

Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.

```javascript
function double(array) {
    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
}
```
For example:
```javascript
var someNumbers = [1,2,10,57];

double(someNumbers); // should return [2,4,20,114]
```
